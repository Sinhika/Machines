# Machines

Repository for the Minecraft/Forge mod, 'Machines'.

Created by AleXndrTheGr8st, maintained by Sinhika.

Currently adds two improved furnaces, the mythril furnace that burns more efficiently,
and the onyx furnace, that has improved yields. In danger of being superceded by improved 
vanilla furnaces such as the Blast Furnace and the Smoker.

Forge 1.15.2 port enabled thanks to Cadiboo's LGPL-licensed example code https://github.com/Cadiboo/Example-Mod that he made free to all to borrow, in the hopes of encouraging good coding practices in Forge mods. I hope I did a good job with it.

**Very much a Work-in-Progress!**

### New TO-DO list
 * create Mythril Blast Furnace
 * create Mythril Smoker
 * create Onyx Blast Furnace
 * create Onyx Smoker
 * there are textures for Tin Fusion Furnace and Adamantinum Fusion Furnace. What should they do?
 * fix progress arrow acting weird / furnaces burn time being a tick or so shorter than it should be.
 
### Old TO-DO list
 * Mythril furnace texture is 1 pixel too high.
 * Add Adamantium Furnace - Cooks faster, fuel efficient.
 * Make Onyx Furnace smelt faster
 * Sinisite Furnace - Cooks 2x as fast, fuel efficient, extra yield, and can use nether fuels.
 * Thyrium Furnace - Combined abilities of Mythril and Adamantium Furnaces.
 * Ashstone Furnace - A Nether furnace that cooks a bit faster than a Nether Furnace
